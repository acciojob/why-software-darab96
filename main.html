	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
		<p>Becoming a software developer unlocks the problem solving skill set of a person that has been around for a while and nobody else knows how to solve. As a Software Developer a person constantly provide solutions for users’ problems. He/She can be working on the occasional quick fix as well as more complex strategic solutions.</p>
		<p>Being in Software Development isn’t quite the same as being a Graphic Designer or Fine Artist, but that doesn’t mean it’s not creative in its own way. There are many ways in which Software Developers can be creative, including in the way you think to solve a problem. Creativity is just one of the many reasons to become a Software Engineer.</p>
		<p>Another reason to become a Software Developer is the varied work structure which is project-based. Generally, you will be working on a huge variety of projects, both large and small, and there are so many advantages to this working style.</p>
		<p>Technology is extremely fast moving, so Software Engineers need to be able to learn new programming languages and technologies and adapt to the continually changing environment. Alongside learning about technology, developers will often have the opportunity to develop their knowledge about the business and sector they are working in, as these are also ever-changing.</p>
